# Build A Raspberry Pi Space Invaders Controller
In this tutorial, we’ll build a mini game controller, wire it to a Raspberry Pi’s GPIO pins and write a program in Python to recognise the button presses. Finally we’ll examine and run a space invaders game, modified with the methods we’ve just learnt about to work with our controller.
